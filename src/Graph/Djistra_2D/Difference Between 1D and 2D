1-D : QUEUE

We take Queue <int[]> where we push
1 Integer as destination node ,
1 Integer as destination distance
So,
int,int better go with int[][]


2-D : QUEUE

We take Queue <List<int[],int>> ot int[][] where we push
1 int[] as destination co-ordinate ,
  Each int[]
   x coordinate
   y coordinate
1 Integer as destination distance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1-D : Distance:

Here as it's 1D, so there is only 1 distance possible to move forward or backward .



2-D : Distance:

Here as it's 2-D , we can go to 4 or 8 distance possible ... we have to iterate on each distance
a direction array is needed to change X,Y co-ordinate

Every time, to get the distance , we need to compute distance by subtracting two coordinate value
And then use max to jump on that new value
