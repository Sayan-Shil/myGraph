Floyd Warshall Rule is applicable to find a 2-D matrices to find minimum distance from each vertices to another vertices.
Its complexity is v*E * V = VVE almost n3

For every vertices the following will happen

                             Via A         Via B        Via C  -----------

    (a,b)                 a-->A-->b       a-->B-->b   a-->C-->b

                    min((a,b),(a-->A-->b)
